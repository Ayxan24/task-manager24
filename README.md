# Task Manager
A simple and clean task management web app built for learning full-stack development.  
Tasks appear as draggable panels that users can reorder, move between categories, and manage visually.

## ✨ Features
- Drag-and-drop task cards
- Move tasks between categories
- Reorder tasks visually
- Backend state updates mirror every UI action
- Stores data in JSON (lightweight, no database needed)
- Minimal, easy-to-understand codebase

## 🧰 Tech Stack
### Frontend
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SortableJS

### Backend
- Java + Spring Boot
- JSON-based persistence

## 🔧 How to run
- Host backend from Springboot/Backend
- Open Html file from intex.html

## 🎯 Why This Project?
I built this to understand:
- Component-based UI logic  
- Clean backend design  
- Syncing UI actions with backend state  


## 📌 Current Status
- UI and drag/drop system semi functional.
- Backend mirrors actions and maintains a JSON file  
- More features planned (categories, deadlines, priorities)
